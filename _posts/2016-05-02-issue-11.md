### [Today’s Ride-hailing Data Could Change Tomorrow’s Public Buses](https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/split-ride-hailing-algorithm-routes-city-bus)
For about as long as consumers have had access to GPS technology, scientists have wondered if our reliance on it harms our ability to navigate on our own. Signs point to yes, but given the way smartphone GPS has transformed the way we drive, bike, walk, get taxis and take transit, that might just be a tradeoff we live with for the foreseeable future.

### [Over-politeness Is The Fatal Flaw In The Open Data Movement](http://civichall.org/civicist/over-politeness-is-the-fatal-flaw-in-the-open-data-movement/)
There are many reasons why progress has been sporadic. People often point to the lack of a robust business case to justify either why new spending is justifiable or new laws are worth introducing, in the name of open data. Many people also blame governments for simply not wanting to be open, but that feels a bit like blaming sheep for having woolen coats. What I want to highlight is a different problem, a problem that we in the open data community must own up to because we could have done something about it: we have been entirely too polite for our own good.

### [How Open Data And New Technologies Hold Keys To The Media’s Future Across Africa](https://medium.com/code-for-africa/how-open-data-and-new-technologies-hold-keys-to-the-medias-future-across-africa-9dcf3c9d855e#.g4jrz1tzv)
The spread of mobile phones and connectivity across Africa offers opportunities and challenges for the way that information will be discovered and used by citizens. If people have the skills and knowledge to harness them, open data and new technologies hold the keys to the media’s future.

### [How The City Of Boston Is Making Its Data Accessible To Everyone](http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2016/4/26/how-city-boston-making-its-data-accessible-everyone/)
Boston Public Library Interim President David Leonard nicely grounded the conversation with remarks that articulated the enduring importance of libraries as community centers of learning. This key observation serves as the foundation for this open data initiative and was recently quantified in a Pew Research Center survey that found that nearly 80 percent of Americans wanted their libraries to offer programming on digital tools.

### [What Exactly Is A 'smart' City?](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2016/04/26/what-is-a-smart-city)
Some smart city advocates emphasize efforts to engage and connect with residents, others emphasize infrastructure. But the general goal — something no city has yet achieved — is to collect immediate data on everything from traffic patterns to home water use, analyze it, and use that information to make the city work better.

### [Volunteers Develop Data Dashboard For Sacramento](http://statescoop.com/volunteers-are-building-a-data-dashboard-to-improve-local-governance)
The new "civic operating system" could help local leaders make better decisions about how to spend government money, creators said.

### [Data Gleaned From Next-gen 911 System Drives Improved Emergency Response](http://www.govtech.com/Data-Gleaned-from-Next-Gen-911-System-Drives-Improved-Emergency-Response.html)
