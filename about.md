### What is Civic Tech Weekly?
Civic Tech Weekly is a curated weekly newsletter of civic technology related  links.

### Why Make A Weekly Newsletter?
When I first got into the civic tech scene, I had trouble keeping up with the latest ideas. I hoped to find a brief, digestible, curated newsletter like this, but one didn't exist - so, here we are!

### Who is behind this?
My name is Isaac Chansky. I work with civic tech people & help run Code for Boston - a local chapter of Code for America.
