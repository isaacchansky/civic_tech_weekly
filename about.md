### What is Civic Tech Weekly?
Civic Tech Weekly is a curated weekly newsletter of civic technology related  links.

### Why Make A Weekly Newsletter?
Well, when I first began to get an interest in civic technology, I had hoped to find a brief, digestible, curated newsletter like this - but one didn't exist... so, here we are!

### Who is behind this?
My name is Isaac Chansky. I work & play with civic technology & help run Code for Boston - a local chapter of Code for America.
